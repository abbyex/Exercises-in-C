<b>Some of the assignments I was given as part of my module in ANSI-C</b>

<b>Turtle</b><br />
Based on (['Turtle Graphics'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)), I built a parser and interpreter which could take a set of file instructions such as 'Forward 30, Left 45' and build graphical structures such as the examples below:

</p>

<b>ADTs: Hashing</b><br />
Using a hashing algorithm that searches through text (eg 'Pride and Prejudice ' book) to find specific words. 

<b>Forest Fires</b><br />
Creating a terminal stimulation of a 'Forest fire' following a set of logical rules given to us in the assignment based on how the fire behaves, and what creates tree growth (see gif below). The @'s represent trees, and the \*'s represent fire.
